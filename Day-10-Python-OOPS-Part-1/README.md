# Day 10 – Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## Covered Concepts

- **Methods:** `__init__` constructor, instance methods.
- **Inheritance:** Single and Multiple inheritance (e.g., `Dog` inheriting from `Animal` and `Pet`).
- 

## Why it matters for AI?
Most modern AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn) rely heavily on OOP. Custom models are defined as classes that inherit from a base model class.
