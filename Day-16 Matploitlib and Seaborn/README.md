# Day 16 – Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Covered Concepts
- **Matplotlib:** Basic plotting (Line, Scatter, Bar, Histogram, Pie) and customizing figure layouts.
- **Seaborn:** Advanced statistical plots (Heatmaps, Pair Plots, Box Plots) for identifying patterns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.

## Why it matters for AI?
- **Feature Selection:** Heatmaps help us see which features are correlated, allowing us to select the best inputs for our models.
- **Outlier Detection:** Box plots make it easy to spot anomalies that could confuse a machine learning algorithm.
