# Day 3 – Inbuilt Data Structures

## Covered
- **Lists & List Comprehensions**: Creating, indexing, slicing, and concise loops.
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences and their use cases.
- **Sets**: Unique collections and set operations (union, intersection).
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, methods, and real-world use cases.

## Why it matters
- Efficient data manipulation is the core of any ML pipeline.
- Knowing the time complexity differences (e.g., set lookups vs list lookups) is crucial for optimization.
