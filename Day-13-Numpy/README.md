# Day 13 – NumPy for Data Science

## Covered Concepts
- **NumPy Arrays:** Creation, Indexing, and Slicing.
- **Vectorization:** Performing operations on entire arrays without loops (faster execution).
- **Statistical Analysis:** Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation.


## Why it matters for AI?
- **Performance:** NumPy is optimized in C, making it 10-100x faster than standard Python lists.
- **Foundation:** All ML frameworks (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch) are built on top of NumPy array structures.
