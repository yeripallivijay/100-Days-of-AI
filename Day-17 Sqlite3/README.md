# Day 17 – Databases with SQLite and Python

## Covered Concepts
- **Database Connection:** Using `sqlite3` to connect to a local database.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Creating tables (`CREATE TABLE`) directly from Python.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** inserting (`INSERT`), updating, and querying (`SELECT`) data.
- **Efficiency:** Using `executemany` for batch inserts.

## Why it matters for AI?
- **Data Pipelines:** Most companies store their data in SQL databases (Postgres, MySQL, Snowflake). An AI engineer must know how to extract this data for training.
