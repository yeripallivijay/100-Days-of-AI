# Day 2 – Python Control Flow

## Covered
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Looping constructs: `for` loops, `while` loops
- Small exercises: age-based checks, grading logic, pattern and counter loops

## Why it matters for AI Engineering
- Control flow is the backbone of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation pipelines.
- Clear branching and looping logic makes ML code easier to debug and extend.
