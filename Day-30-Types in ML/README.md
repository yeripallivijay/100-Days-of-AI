# Day 30 – Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview
Today marks the start of the Machine Learning module. I explored the fundamental types of machine learning and when to apply each.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Supervised Learning
The model learns from labeled training data.
- **Classification:** Discrete output (e.g., Email Spam filter).
- **Regression:** Continuous output (e.g., Predicting stock prices).

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
The model deals with unlabeled data and discovers hidden structures.
- **Clustering:** Grouping data points (e.g., Customer segmentation).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing variables (e.g., PCA).

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
An agent takes actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
