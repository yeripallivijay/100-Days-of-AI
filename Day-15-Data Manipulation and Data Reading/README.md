# Day 15 – Advanced Data Manipulation

## Covered Concepts
- **Data Ingestion:** Reading from CSV, Excel (`read_excel`), JSON (`read_json`), and HTML (`read_html`).
- **Merging & Joining:** Using `pd.merge()` to combine datasets based on keys (Inner, Outer, Left, Right).
- **Concatenation:** Stacking DataFrames vertically/horizontally.
- **Advanced Transformations:** Using `.apply()` and lambda functions for custom feature engineering.

## Why it matters for AI?
- **Data Integration:** Real AI systems often need to combine user data (SQL) with behavioral logs (JSON) and third-party data (CSV/API).
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones is often the biggest booster for model accuracy.
