# Day 1 – Python Setup & Fundamentals

## Completed
- VS Code setup for Python.
- Created and activated virtual environments (conda / venv).
- Reviewed Python basics: syntax & semantics, variables, data types, operators.

## Why it matters for AI Engineering
- Reproducible environments are essential for ML experiments and deployments.
- Strong Python fundamentals make it easier to implement ML, DL, and MLOps code later.
