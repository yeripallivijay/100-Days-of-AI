## Types
- **Agglomerative** (Bottom-Up): Start with individual points → Merge clusters.
- **Divisive** (Top-Down): Start with all data → Split clusters.

## Linkage Methods
- **Ward:** Minimizes variance (Most Common).
- **Complete:** Max distance between points in merged clusters.
- **Average:** Average distance between points in merged clusters.

## Dendrogram
Tree diagram showing:
- **Height:** Distance at which clusters merge.
- **Horizontal Cut:** Defines number of clusters.
