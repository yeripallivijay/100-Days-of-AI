# Day 7 – Python File Handling

## Covered
- **Reading/Writing:** Modes `r`, `w`, `a` (append).
- **Context Managers:** Using `with open()` for safe resource management.
- **Text Analysis:** Built a script to count lines, words, and characters in a file.
- **File Copying:** Programmatically transferring data from `source.txt` to `destination.txt`.

## Why it matters
- AI models need data. That data lives in files.
- Efficient file I/O is crucial for building data pipelines and logging systems.
