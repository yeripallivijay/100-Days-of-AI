# Day 11 – Advanced OOP Concepts in Python

## Covered Concepts
- **Encapsulation:** Restricting access to methods and variables using private attributes (`__var`) and property decorators.
- **Polymorphism:** Method overriding and operator overloading.
- **Abstraction:** Using `ABC` (Abstract Base Classes) and `@abstractmethod` to define blueprints for derived classes.

## Why it matters for AI?
- **Abstraction** is key in Deep Learning frameworks (e.g., all models must implement a `forward` pass).
- **Polymorphism** allows us to swap different models (e.g., ResNet vs. VGG) without changing the training loop code.
