# Day 27 – Feature Engineering

## Covered Concepts
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Handling nulls in continuous and categorical data.
- **Encoding:** One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, Ordinal Encoding.
- **Transformation:** Standardization (Z-score) and Normalization (Min-Max).
- **Outlier Engineering:** Detecting and handling outliers using IQR and Z-scores.

## Why it matters for AI?
- **Model Performance:** Good features often contribute more to model accuracy than hyperparameter tuning.
- **Algorithm Compatibility:** Most ML algorithms (like SVM, K-Means) require numerical input and scaled data to function correctly.
